# Bike theft maps

### [maps.bikewise.org](http://maps.bikewise.org)

Maps of bike thefts, from [bikeindex.org](https://bikeindex.org) reports. Location data from [bikewise.org](https://bikewise.org), built with [Mapbox](https://mapbox.org).

Intended to be used as examples of what is possible, and also to help give an idea of how the [BikeWise API](https://bikewise.org/documentation) can be used. Also, it's pretty cool.

### Running it locally

This is a [Jekyll project](http://jekyllrb.com/) - so once you've installed jekyll, all you need to do is run `jekyll serve` from the directory and it will start a local copy that updates on changes.

To edit what is going on, open [assets/base.coffee](assets/base.coffee).
