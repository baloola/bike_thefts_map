# Bike theft maps

Maps of bike thefts, from [bikeindex.org](https://bikeindex.org) reports. Location data from [bikewise.org](https://bikewise.org), built with [Mapbox](https://mapbox.org).

Intended to be used as examples of what is possible, and also to help give an idea of how the [BikeWise API](https://bikewise.org/documentation) can be used.

### Running it locally

This is a [Jekyll project](http://jekyllrb.com/) - so once you've installed jekyll, all you need to do is run `jekyll serve` from the directory and it will start a local copy that updates on changes.

To edit what is going on, open [index.html](index.html). The javascript is inlined right now, but it will be improved in the future.

This will eventually be much more interactive, and have cool filters and tools for exploring bike data.

For now though... it's pretty static.

Also, browser windows will eventually get bogged down because of ever increasing map markers that aren't cleaned up, and if you zoom out it doesn't cluster like it should.

And it starts in Portland, always.
